- **React Router**: For handling client-side routing.

## Installation

### Prerequisites:

- **Node.js** (>=14.x)
- **npm** or **yarn**

### Steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/home-budgeting-app.git
   cd home-budgeting-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies for both frontend and backend**:

   ```bash
   # Install frontend dependencies
   cd frontend
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install

   # Install backend dependencies
   cd ../backend
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up the database**:
   Ensure SQLite is properly configured. The application will automatically create tables upon starting the backend in `/backend/data`.

4. **Start the backend server**:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   node index.js
   ```

   This will start the server on `http://localhost:5001`.

5. **Start the frontend server**:

   In a new terminal window in the base folder:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the React application on `http://localhost:3000`.
